# Random Notes
* I couldn't just install `pocketsphinx` on macOS via Pip. Had to follow the instructions linked here: https://github.com/bambocher/pocketsphinx-python/issues/28#issuecomment-597794252 (except my AL version number was different), and then use the pip install command here: https://github.com/bambocher/pocketsphinx-python/issues/28#issuecomment-849265015

# Packages I don't need
* sounddevice
* simpleaudio
* pocketsphinx
